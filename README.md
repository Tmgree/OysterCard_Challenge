# Oystercard

This is a repeat of the [oystercard-challenge](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/oystercard) written Ruby. You can find my original Ruby solution [at this repo](https://github.com/Tmgree/OysterCard).

I have aimed to solve this challenge in a test driven manner with automated tests using the unittest library.

## Installation Instructions

Clone the repository then change directory into it.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Tmgree/OysterCard_Challenge.git
$ cd OysterCard_Challenge
```

Now you can use the oystercard system.
